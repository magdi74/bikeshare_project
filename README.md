Project Overview:

Here we have some bike data from three different cities in the US in .csv files and we want to analyse/extract some data from it to answer some questions by using pandas 
such as:


Popular times of travel
The most common month
The most common day of week
The most common hour of day

Popular stations and trip
The most common start station
The most common end station
The most common trip from start to end

and more other questions


How to run:
clone the repository after that download the packages then run the bikeshare_2.py

at the begining you choose a city from the valid cities.

then you choose the way to filter the data either by month or day or both of them
you can choose none for no filter at all.

then you choose the month and the day and the data will be loaded for you.
